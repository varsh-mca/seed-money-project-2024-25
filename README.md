🎯 Problem Statement
Our college had no digital platform for managing co-curricular forums for UG students (1st & 2nd year). With 12 different forums available, students faced several challenges:

Manual registration process was time-consuming and error-prone
Limited slots per forum created conflicts when friend groups wanted to join together
No centralized communication system between students and forum coordinators
No proper tracking of student achievements and attendance
Difficulty in managing student preferences and forum capacity

💡 Our Solution
We developed a comprehensive web-based management system that streamlines the entire co-curricular forum process, making it efficient, transparent, and student-friendly.
