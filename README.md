🎯 Problem Statement
Our college had no digital platform for managing co-curricular forums for UG students (1st & 2nd year). With 12 different forums available, students faced several challenges:

Limited slots per forum created conflicts when friend groups wanted to join together
No centralized communication system between students and forum coordinators

We developed a comprehensive web-based management system that streamlines the entire co-curricular forum process, making it efficient, transparent, and student-friendly.
